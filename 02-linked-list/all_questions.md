# QUESTION 1 Swap Head and Tail

Finish the function `swapHeadAndTail`, which will switch the place of the first item and the last item in the linked list.

Do note that since the `LinkedListEx` inherits from the `LinkedList` class, all the latter's variables and methods are available for use in the former.

# QUESTION 2 Merge List

Complete the function `mergeList`, which takes in two `LinkedList` objects as argument, `listA` and `listB`.

Your task is to add all the nodes from `listB` to the end of `listA`. You are _not to return anything_ from the `mergeList` function.
